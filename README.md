# Anti-Malarial-Natural-Products

During my summer research of 2015 I joined Dr. May's Research group at the University of Houston. 

Here is a cool picture of the lab!

At this research the goal was to improve the biological activity of a antimalarial natural product isolated from the genus Flindersia. The synthesis is really easy after much trial and error. From an easy access starting material tryptamine is transformed in two steps to the natural product borrerine, which is then treated with acid. The resulting cascade sequence results in the selective formation of flinderole A and desmethylflinderole C or isoborreverine depending on the conditions used. If borrerine is first treated with a methylating agent and then acid, flinderole B, flinderole C, and dimethylisoborreverine can be obtained. Quick glance but here is the synthesis:

Unfortunately, my contributions were not as impactful (huge learning curve) but the strategies I learned were more than helpful in my future career!
